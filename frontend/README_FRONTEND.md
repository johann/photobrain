# PhotoBrain Frontend

Minimal Next.js shell aligned with the specification. Replace the mock data with real API calls to the FastAPI backend when available.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Testing

Add component and E2E tests under `src/tests` and `e2e/` respectively. The `npm test` script is wired for Jest but currently expects user-defined tests.
